Background

- Have other form digitization projects been done within the department?
  - What was involved?
  - What were the obstacles?
  - Were they successful? Why or why not?
- What happens once the existing Dog License forms are submitted? What does the process look like on the back end?
- What's the main driver for this project, if you had to pick one? Examples:
  - Improving the applicant experience
  - Making processing more efficient

Lifecycle

- Who is responsible for what, in terms of design, engineering, product, and content?
- Let's say we had this built tomorrow. What would need to happen to get it launched? This may include things like:
  - Privacy paperwork/reviews
  - Security paperwork/reviews
- What does success look like?
- What are the barriers we'll run into?

Specifications

- What does the existing form look like?
  - Does that need to be matched, or can this be used as an opportunity to clarify/streamline?
- What's the minimum viable/valuable product (MVP)? â€¦ What's something even smaller?
- Does the form need to collect / does the system need to store any sensitive information?
- What's the volume of visits/applications that are expected?
- What are the technical constraints, in terms of programming languages, frameworks, hosting, etc?
  - Can/should it be a standalone application, or be built into an existing one?
- What interconnections need to be made with other systems?
  - Do those systems exist already?
- What are the time/budget constraints?

Many of these answers won't be (completely) known up front. Finding answers to the known unknowns will be built into the plan.
