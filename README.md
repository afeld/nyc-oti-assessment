# NYC OTI Assessment

[![Validate Containerize](https://github.com/afeld/nyc-oti-assessment/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/afeld/nyc-oti-assessment/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

This contains my solutions to the [New York City (NYC) Office of Technology & Innovation (OTI)](https://www1.nyc.gov/content/oti/pages/) "Dog License" and "Containerize" [coding assessments](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/cto/downloads/assessments/all_assessments.zip); see [my modifications on top of the template files](https://github.com/afeld/nyc-oti-assessment/compare/3442263...main).

See my [overall comments for Containerize](containerize/COMMENTS.md).

Intentionally left off a license. Despite the agency explicitly saying that the solution can be posted in a public GitHub repository, it's not clear whether a coding assignment submission that others will be assigned should be [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd) (allowing "derived works and redistribution") :slightly_smiling_face: So All Rights Reserved I guess.
