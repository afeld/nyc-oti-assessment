# NYC OTI Assessment

This contains my solutions to the [New York City (NYC) Office of Technology & Innovation (OTI)](https://www1.nyc.gov/content/oti/pages/) "Dog License" and "Containerize" [coding assessments](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/cto/downloads/assessments/all_assessments.zip); see [my modifications on top of the template files](https://github.com/afeld/nyc-oti-assessment/compare/3442263...main).

For Containerize, I copied pieces of [the instructions](containerize/README.md) in as comments to the configuration files to help clarify what lines are doing what.
