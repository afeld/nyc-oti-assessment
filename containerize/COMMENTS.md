# Overall comments

I copied pieces of [the instructions](README.md) in as comments in quotes to the configuration files to help clarify what lines are doing what.

For a production deployment with higher security concerns, my next steps for this project would be going through the following resources to further harden the configuration:

- [CIS NGINX Benchmark](https://downloads.cisecurity.org)
- [NGINX Security Controls](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/)
